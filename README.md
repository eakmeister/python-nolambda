Disclaimer: This is a silly project.

This module allows for more conceise functional programming within python by omitting the "lambda" keyword. For example:

    lambda x: x + 5

can be written instead as:

    _ + 5

This uses the special variable "_" to represent the function argument.

This is the very definition of a hack, and will probably crash your interpreter. You have been warned.
